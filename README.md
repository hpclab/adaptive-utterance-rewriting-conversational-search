## Data
- Datasets: CAsT 2019 dataset divided into training and test sets. More details in the [Dataset README.md](./data/datasets/README.md) file.
- Baselines: all the baselines used in the evaluation. More details in the [Baselines README.md](./data/baselines/README.md) file.
- Rewritten Utterances: utterances rewritten with our approaches. More details in the [rewritten_utterances README.md](./data/rewritten\_utterances/README.md) file.

## Classification
Python notebooks and code for utterance classification. More details in the [Classification README.md](./classification/README.md) file.

## Query resolution
The query resolution module uses both supervised and unsupervised methods for rewriting queries. More details in the [Query resolution README.md](./query_resolution/README.md) file.

## Retrieval
Code used for the retrieval of the results using INDRI.  More details in the [retrieval README.md](./retrieval/README.md) file.

## Re-ranking
Details about how we used BERT for re-ranking are found in the [Reranking README.md](./reranking/README.md) file.
